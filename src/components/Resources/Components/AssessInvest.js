      <h4>
        Rising Investments in Sales Training and Enablement - But Declining
        Quota Attainment
      </h4>
      <p>
        At Sales Performance International we will launch a new web site this
        week. As a global leader in sales training and performance improvement
        for nearly three decades, weâ€™ve reached the conclusion that sales
        organizations need to fundamentally re-think their approach to
        performance improvement initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States alone annual{" "}
        <span className="correction">spending</span> on corporate sales training
        is estimated to be at least three billion dollars. In spite of these
        investments, and billions more in sales technology, annual quota
        attainment is on a five-year decline. Recent research by HubSpot of 200
        enterprise organizations led to the conclusion that some $66 billion
        spent on overall sales enablement has not resulted in any major
        productivity increase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly, some companies have realized improved sales effectiveness and
        positive business outcomes from investment in professional development
        for sales people. But overall, the bottom line (literally) is that
        training Investments are not resulting in behavior change that is having
        impact on measurable outcomes.
